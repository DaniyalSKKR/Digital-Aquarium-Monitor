# Digital-Aquarium-Monitor
In the aquarium hobby, maintaining proper and consistent water quality is the most vital part to keeping any sort of aquatic creatures healthy and thriving in the tank ecosystem. Currently, water testing requires the rigorous process of filling individual testing bottles with tank water, adding in specific dosing of signaling chemicals, and manually having to color match the test water to a reference card. With our project, we hope to be able to automate the last step for different aquarium metrics such as nitrite, temperature, and ammonia, all of which are vital for any successful fish keeper to know.

Our project will incorporate numerous input/output devices to undertake all the required tasks. As an input device, we will use a color sensor in one of our subsystems to be able to automate the process of matching the color of our test water to that of a reference card, with a toggle switch to be able to distinguish exactly which metric (ammonia or nitrite) is being measured. As a second input device, we have stainless steel temperature probe that we will be able to measure the temperature. Much of our output will go directly to an LCD screen that is able to give helpful feedback to the user, as well as LEDs to specifically indicate when ammonia levels are too high or if they are safe for fish.
