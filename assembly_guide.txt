Materials Needed
1. Two Arduino Uno's and corresponding breadboards, 
2. Two LCD monitors
3. Green and red LEDs
4. 4 220 Ohm resistors, 1 10K resistor, 2 1K resistors
4. TC-34725 RGB color sensor
5. DS18B20 temperature probe
6. 2 Buttons 
7. Testing solution for treating the water and test vials.

Subsystem 1: Temperature Measurement
1. First, wire the Arduino’s GND pin to the GND rail and 5V PS to the PS rail.
2. Wire the 2x16 LCD screen to the breadboard. Link the components of the LCD to
Arduino in the respective arrangement: rs = 9, en = 8, d4 = 2, d5 = 3, d6 = 4, d7 = 7. Wire
VSS, RW, and K to GND rail. Link VDD to PS rail as well as A with a 220 Ohm resistor
attached.
It is optional to include a potentiometer, but if included, wire V0 to the center pin on the
potentiometer and the remaining pins on the GND rail and PS rail.
3. Add 2 LED’s, green and red. Dedicate the green led to pin 5 and the red to pin 6,
including 220 ohm resistors for each LED. GND both LEDs.
4. The temperature probe requires the red wire to be linked to the PS rail, the blue should
link to pin 2 on the Arduino, and black goes to GND. An additional wire should connect
the blue wire to a 220 Ohm resistor and connect back to the red wire of the temperature
probe.

Subsystem 2: Ammonia/Nitrite Monitor
1. Begin by repeating steps 1 and 2 from subsystem 1.
2. Attach the color sensor to the breadboard, then connect the following pins:
Connect SCL to Arduino SCL
Connect SDA to Arduino SDA
Connect VIN to 5V DC
Connect GROUND to common ground GND
3. Utilize available pins 5 and 6 for buttons used to control whether ammonia or nitrate
testing will be initiated. Be sure to ground. Include 1k ohm resistors for each respective
button.
