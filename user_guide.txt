Setup:
- First, ensure that both Arduino Uno's are plugged into a computer or USB power source.
- Next, load the proper .ino file used to process I/O from the hardware components.
- Connect the two Arduino boards to establish serial communication (1 wire to GND on each, 2 alternating between RX and TX on each board).
- After this step the system is ready for use.

Subsystem 1: Temperature Measurement
- First, get the temperature sensor, which is a stainless steel probe connected to the end of a long wire, from the breadboard.
- Place the sensor inside of the aquarium tank water.
- Wait approximately 60 seconds for the sensor to properly acclimate to the temperature of the water.
- Read the output shown on the LCD monitor, which will output the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.
-If temperature is outside of valid bounds for tropical aquarium fish, address issue before moving on to test subsystem 2.

Subsystem 2: Ammonia/Nitrite Monitor
- First, fill a standard API Test Kit test tube up to the white line indicated with aquarium water.
- Select the chemical testing solution that matches with the desired metric.
- Add the indicated number of drops to the testing vial and shake for 5 seconds.
- Wait around 1-2 minutes. This is to ensure that the chemical reaction has enough time to be fully completed before taking any measurements.
- Place the test tube on top of the RGB color sensor & cover until no ambient light can reach the test tube.
- Select the appropriate button to indicate which metric you want to measure, and confirm by checking the output on the LCD screen.
- Now, read the measurement from the LCD screen. The green or red LED will also light up based on whether or not the 
  measured ammonia/nitrite levels were within parameters that are safe for fish to inhabit.
- Empty the test tube, rinse and dry thoroughly before the next run.
